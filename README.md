-	Implement logging mechanisms for admin to track system activities, facilitating auditing and traceability of actions performed by users.
-	The system should allow emails to be sent to users to get an access to the system.
-	Load testing : Conducting regular load testing to ensure the system can handle peak loads without performance issues.
-	Performance requirements ensuring responsiveness and scalability
-	The system code must be easy to read and understand, with clear naming conventions, comments, and documentation.
-	The system must be developed following best practices for code maintainability, such as using design patterns, avoiding code duplication, and keeping code complexity to a minimum.
-	The system must be able to perform its functions efficiently and without errors under different load conditions, such as high traffic or peak usage.
-	The system shall able to run on window 10 or window 11 without change in its behavior.
